      <h2>What is pentest?</h2>
      <p>
        Pentest, short for penetration testing, is a proactive cybersecurity assessment aimed at identifying vulnerabilities within computer systems,
        networks, or applications. Ethical hackers, also known as penetration testers,
        simulate the actions of malicious hackers to uncover security weaknesses before they can be exploited.
        By employing various techniques and tools, these experts meticulously evaluate networks, applications,
        and even physical security measures to provide organizations with valuable insights.
        The results of a pentest enable businesses to fortify their defenses,
        ensuring robust protection against potential cyber threats.
